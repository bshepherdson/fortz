\ This file contains the code for ttester, a utility for testing Forth words,
\ as developed by several authors (see below), together with some explanations
\ of its use.

\ ttester is based on the original tester suite by Hayes:

\ VERSION 1.1
\ All the subsequent changes have been placed in the public domain.
\ The primary changes from the original are the replacement of "{" by "T{"
\ and "}" by "}T" (to avoid conflicts with the uses of { for locals and }
\ for FSL arrays), modifications so that the stack is allowed to be non-empty
\ before T{, and extensions for the handling of floating point tests.
\ Code for testing equality of floating point values comes
\ from ftester.fs written by David N. Williams, based on the idea of
\ approximate equality in Dirk Zoller's float.4th.
\ Further revisions were provided by Anton Ertl, including the ability
\ to handle either integrated or separate floating point stacks.
\ Revision history and possibly newer versions can be found at

\ Explanatory material and minor reformatting (no code changes) by
\ C. G. Montgomery March 2009, with helpful comments from David Williams
\ and Krishna Myneni.

\ Usage:

\ The basic usage takes the form  T{ <code> -> <expected stack> }T .
\ This executes  <code>  and compares the resulting stack contents with
\ the  <expected stack>  values, and reports any discrepancy between the
\ two sets of values.
\ For example:
\ T{ 1 2 3 swap -> 1 3 2 }T  ok
\ T{ 1 2 3 swap -> 1 2 2 }T INCORRECT RESULT: T{ 1 2 3 swap -> 1 2 2 }T ok
\ T{ 1 2 3 swap -> 1 2 }T WRONG NUMBER OF RESULTS: T{ 1 2 3 swap -> 1 2 }T ok

\ Floating point testing can involve further complications.  The code
\ attempts to determine whether floating-point support is present, and
\ if so, whether there is a separate floating-point stack, and behave
\ accordingly.  The CONSTANTs HAS-FLOATING and HAS-FLOATING-STACK
\ contain the results of its efforts, so the behavior of the code can
\ be modified by the user if necessary.

\ Then there are the perennial issues of floating point value
\ comparisons.  Exact equality is specified by SET-EXACT (the
\ default).  If approximate equality tests are desired, execute
\ SET-NEAR .  Then the FVARIABLEs REL-NEAR (default 1E-12) and
\ ABS-NEAR (default 0E) contain the values to be used in comparisons
\ by the (internal) word FNEARLY= .

\ When there is not a separate floating point stack and you want to
\ use approximate equality for FP values, it is necessary to identify
\ which stack items are floating point quantities.  This can be done
\ by replacing the closing }T with a version that specifies this, such
\ as RRXR}T which identifies the stack picture ( r r x r ).  The code
\ provides such words for all combinations of R and X with up to four
\ stack items.  They can be used with either an integrated or separate
\ floating point stacks. Adding more if you need them is
\ straightforward; see the examples in the source.  Here is an example
\ which also illustrates controlling the precision of comparisons:

\   SET-NEAR
\   1E-6 REL-NEAR F!
\   T{ S" 3.14159E" >FLOAT -> -1E FACOS TRUE RX}T

\ The word ERROR is now vectored, so that its action can be changed by
\ the user (for example, to add a counter for the number of errors).
\ The default action ERROR1 can be used as a factor in the display of
\ error reports.

\ Loading ttester.fs does not change BASE.  Remember that floating point input
\ is ambiguous if the base is not decimal.

\ The file defines some 70 words in all, but in most cases only the
\ ones mentioned above will be needed for successful testing.
