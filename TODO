Quetzal saves:
- Implement Quetzal format, first of all.
- Also fix the throw/catch format as specified; currently it's portable between
  runs of my emulator (offset of FP relative to stack-top) but not between
  emulators.

Terminal fanciness:
- v3 status lines and ops to implement them.
- various colour and terminal-control opcodes.
- fonts? terminals usually don't have italic, sometimes bold though. I should
  "support" fixed width as well. not sure what others it can do. reverse video?
- Set default colours in the header, once I know them.
- Support accented characters from the base set. Nasty mapping; lift from Hork.

Advanced terminal fanciness:
- Unicode
- True colour support

Input:
- Terminating character list. Not sure how much is required there.
- Support partly-filled input buffers - redisplaying and such.
- Timer interrupts for reading
- Header can specify custom alphabet tables in v5+.
- Versions 1 and 2 are actually broken because I don't handle the different
  A2 table they use, and the single shift vs. shift lock style.


Misc. advanced ops
- verify opcode - almost identical with my checksum I already built?
- tokenize - requires calling into dictionary logic. Straightforward?
- encode_text - likewise, calling existing string functions
- print_table - fancy cursor support needed? Don't think so.
- check_arg_count - requires modifying call stack handlers.
- 

Misc. cleanup
- Transcription and fixed-width-font bits on restart. Harmless if the font is
  always fixed.
- More efficient object version-dependent functions based on VALUEs.
- Randomizer with predictable mode. Not needed, just a debug helper.
